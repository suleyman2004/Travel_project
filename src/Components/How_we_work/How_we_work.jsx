        In most displays and digital images, resolution is expressed as PPI,
        which refers to the number of pixels that can be displayed over one inch
        of the screen or display. A high PPI means there are more pixels in
        every inch, which results in a higher resolution and a crisper image. If
        the image has a low PPI, it results in a blurry, blocky or pixelated
        image that's difficult to see and interpret. In most displays and
